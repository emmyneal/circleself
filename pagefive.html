	<center><p style="margin-top: 25px">circles are important. they make up everything- from wasp’s nests to tambourines to the very
cells that comprise all of us. cells. they were discovered by robert hooke in 1665. he named them
after monastery cells due to their similar and repetitive appearance. cells are the most small,
basic unit of life, and they are made of circles. who knew a shape as simple as a circle could be
so significant?</p>
	<p>circles are everything. they make up everything. they represent everything. a circle never ends. it
flows from beginning to end, where neither of which are definable. no start, no stop, no stress
points- everything, all at once.</p>
		<p>circles are wholeness. fullness. a sense that everything will be okay with time. that everything
will pass and the spark will come back again. no worries, no ailments, just movement throughout
the circle. everything that once was will be again, because the circle keeps moving. from
beginning to end. where neither of which are definable.</p>
		<p>circles are pure. unplagued by corners or jagged edges. separate from other categories of shape,
untainted by their narratives. incredibly unique. incredibly personal.</p>
		<p>for the last several weeks, my life has been consumed by circles. in every aspect. i don’t know
why they’ve had such a profound impact on me. i like to think that it means something, that i
gravitate towards the circles because of what they represent, but at this point, i'm not even sure.</p>
		<p>i have collected a few items that not only represent circles, but aspects of myself. in other words,
a self portrait in circles. the wasp nest, the stone, the crystal, the tambourine, the sculpture, the
bolts, the books, the lights, and the drawings.</p>
	  <p>and now i ask the viewer: what feelings do circles invoke in you? what do these objects mean to
you? do you feel positively? negatively? neutrally? i invite the viewers to come experience these
objects firsthand. come join us, and explore the world of circles.</p>
