		<center><p style="margin-right: 300px; margin-left: 300px">in circles, dreams begin to bloom,
round and round, in endless room.
echoes of laughter, whispers of fears,
in the dance of circles, time disappears.

round and round, in endless room,
echoes of stories, birth and gloom.
in the dance of circles, time disappears,
boundless cycles, soothing our fears.</p></center>
	<center><p style="margin-top: 7px; margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px">circles... endless loops of continuity, swirling in the vast expanse of existence. they're everywhere, from the celestial bodies dancing in the night sky to the ripples forming on a tranquil pond. round and round they go, echoing the cyclical rhythms of life itself. there's a mesmerizing simplicity in their form, yet a profound complexity in their symbolism. they signify unity, wholeness, and eternity. as i contemplate circles, i can't help but feel drawn into their infinite embrace, marveling at their perfection and pondering the mysteries they hold. in their boundless symmetry, circles invite introspection, reminding me of the interconnectedness of all things.</p></center>
